This is a repo that has the game Minesweeper in multiple programming languages.

# About The Game
> 1. Minesweeper is a game played in a grid of squares.
> 2. These squares have a chance of containing a bomb.
> 3. These bombs are randomly placed throughout the grid.
> 4. If a grid square with one of the bombs is selected to be dug then the player loses the game.
> 5. In play during the game, the player can either chose to dig a square or flag a square if they believe it has a bomb in it.
> 6. If a player digs a square, then the number of bombs in a 3x3 grid around that square is displayed on the selected square.
> 7. If this number is zero, then the program recursively iterates on all squares around the one selected.
> 8. This recursive loop stops once a square has a value that does not equal zero
> 9. This game continues until the player loses the game or until all squares of the grid are filled.
